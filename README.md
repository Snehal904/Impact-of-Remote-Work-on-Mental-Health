In today's evolving work environment, remote work has become a critical topic, and understanding its effect on mental health is more important than ever. 
Through this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of key metrics like:
🔸 Stress levels across different regions
🔸 Job roles and their correlation with satisfaction in remote settings
🔸 Sleep quality and its impact on productivity
🔸 The role of physical activities in maintaining work-life balance

Each visualization offers unique insights into how the shift to remote work has affected individuals, uncovering trends in productivity and overall mental well-being. From job satisfaction to the changing dynamics of physical activity, this project presents data-driven insights aimed at fostering better work environments.

Key Insights:
⭐ The employees working with Remote work location have high stress level as compared to the employees having Hybrid and Remote work location
⭐ Most of the employees whose Work-Life Balance rating is 5 (out of 5) are Unsatisfied with their Remote Location
⭐ The count of the employees that are having Low Stress Level is more than the employees having Medium and High Stress level. (Employees that are working Remotely and having Work-Life Balance rating as 5 (out of 5))
